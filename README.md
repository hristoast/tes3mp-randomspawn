# RandomSpawn

**Requires [DataManager](https://github.com/tes3mp-scripts/DataManager)!**

Randomize where new players spawn, comes with default spawn points that are fully configurable.

Heavily based on [ccSuite](https://github.com/Texafornian/ccSuite)'s implementation, special thanks to Texafornian for making that!
